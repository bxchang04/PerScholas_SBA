    <h1>Coding 101</h1>
    <p>
      "In the context of the software industry, what is coding?"" "What is the
      difference between coding, programming, software development, and software
      engineering?" Experts and beginners agree that coding is much more basic
      and fundamental*. Coding is the physical act of inputting code into a
      program in order to create software. After ten years of dabbling with code
      and attending two web development bootcamps, I am convinced that coding is
      one of my most neglicted skills -- despite the fact that I practiced it
      daily as a freelance web developer. Yet thankfully enough, I recently
      discovered this a set of techniques that have drastically improved my
      coding effectiveness and efficiency. Today, in the form of this website, I
      present to you "Coding 101" -- an interactive page that will help you
      achieve similar results.

      *This is purely based on subjective research and observation. For more
      objective sources, please refer to Wikipedia or the Oxford English
      Dictionary.

      This site isn't meant to make you a better engineer, developer, problem
      solver, or tech expert overnight. However, it will immediate increase your
      productivity, comfort, and engagement while coding. And by
      tech professional, I am including anyone who uses a computer at home or in
      the workplace. My hypothesis is regular users (those who utilize this site
      for at least 30 minutes a day for 1-3 consecutive months) will experience
      a 50% to 200% increase in terms of overall coding efficiency* (includes
      typing, editing, and other common tasks).
