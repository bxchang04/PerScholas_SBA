		<h1>Coding 101</h1>
		<p>
      "What is coding?""

      "What is the difference between coding, programming, software development, and software engineering?"

      A few Google searches should be enough to most people that coding is much more basic than the other terms above. You can even think of "Codi"(ng) as the baby brother of the development and engineering family.

      That said, who in their right mind would dedicate an entire website to this cute yet basic topic? 

      "Not I," once said this author. 
      
      ...Yet after ten years of dabbling with code and two full-time full stack developer bootcamps, I am fully convinced that coding has been one of my weakest links in my skillset as a freelance developer.
      
      I, and most coders, developers, and engineers in the field, have yet to unlock our full coding potential.

      
      This site isn't meant to make you a better engineer, developer, problem solver, or tech expert overnight. However, if you dedicate yourself to at least 30 minutes to fully explore this site, I guarantee you will learn a new skill or improve upon an existing one that will benefit you for your entire career. 



      These interactive activities are designed for those who are new to programming or looking to improve their speed, efficiency, and focus while coding.
